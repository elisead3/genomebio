Today we set up mamba and retrieved the sequence data and reference data that we will be working with, and downloaded the PFam-A database. We then evaluated the quality of our Illumina reads using the fastqc program. 

* [E. coli sbatch](ecoli_fastqc.sbatch)
* [Read 1 fastqc](fastqc_output/read_1_fastqc.html)
* [Read 2 fastqc](fastqc_output/read_2_fastqc.html)
