# genomebio

(Completing Chapter 2 Tasks 2-6) Today we trimmed our E. coli reads using trim_galore, and ran another quality check on the trimmed reads. We tested a method to take a random subsample of the data for a quick analysis. We learned about digital normalization, contamination checking, sequencing errors, and PCR duplications. Then we indexed our reference genome using BWA's index function. We then performed our first mapping of reads to a reference genome using BWA mem.
